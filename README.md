# BitBar-WorldCup

Small script to show current/daily World Cup information from https://github.com/estiens/world_cup_json in your [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com).

## Requirements

Needs Steve Edson's fantastic [bitbar-php](https://github.com/SteveEdson/bitbar-php). Follow the instructions on that project's page to install it using composer.

That's the only dependency, and Steve's script has no dependencies, other than composer in your php installation.

Then put `bitbar-worldcup.1m.php` in your bitbar scripts folder.

Active game shows in menubar, using the FIFA abbreviations for that authentic feel 🙂.

Completed and active games display goalscorers in dropdown. Completed games link to FIFA's [Official Match Reports](https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/).

All data comes from the [JSON WorldCup API](http://worldcup.sfg.io)
